# First create a destination bucket in the another region (verisioning should be enabled for cross region replication to work)

# In the source bucket create a new replication rule. Browse the destination bucket, choose the IAM role (or create new)

# You can also change destination storage class (Standard IA, OneZone, Glacier etc)

# It will ask if you want to replicate existing objects, if you say yes a batch job will run to replicate the existing objects

# Once the rule is created, whenever any object is added in your source bucket the repplication will run and the object will sync to destination bucket
