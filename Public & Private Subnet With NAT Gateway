# Create a custom VPC, choose a CIDR (ex 10.0.0.0/16)

# Create a public subnet,select custom VPC, choose a AZ (1a), choose a CIDR (10.0.0.0/24)

# Create a private subnet,select custom VPC, choose a AZ (1b), choose a CIDR (10.0.1.0/24)

# Create a new internet gateway,attach it to your custom VPC. Internet gateways connect our VPC to internet

# Create a new route table, select custom VPC . Add internet route (0.0.0.0) and select your Internet gateway
Select subnet association , edit it and select your public subnet. This will connect your public subnet to the internet

# Go to your public subnet and enable auto assign IPv4 address so that any public instances created in your public instance get a public IP

# Launch a public instance (ex webserver) , select custom VPC, public subnet . Connect your instance

# Launch a private instance (ex db server), select custom VPC, private subnet. This instance wont get any public IP as i
Make sure you enforce the rules in security group that it can be only ssh from the public subnet CIDR range. Add a another ICMP rule to test connectivity, allow it only from public subnet CIDR range

# Only option to connect is via public instance , this is also called as  a bastion host
For setting this up, copy the keypair from local system to your public instance
$ scp -i keypair.pem keypair.pem ubuntu@<public-ip>:~

$ chmod 600 keypair.pem (Change the permissions of your keypair)
After this connect your private instance with the keypair from your public instance
$ ssh -i keypair.pem ubuntu@<private-ip>

(By default all instances within a VPC can communicate with each other privately)

# The private instance doesnt have connectivity with the internet, so you will not be able to update any packages as you are not able to connect to internet

# In this scenarios, we attach a NAT gateway to the private subnet
Nat gateways are deployed in public subnet so that they can connect to the internet (VV IMP)

# Create Nat gateway, select your public subnet , allocate a public IP address and created

# Now you need to add the NAT gateway route in your main route table
Add internet route (0.0.0.0) and select your NAT gateway
Your private instance will be connected to internet now.

# AWS NAT gateway is a 1 way NAT. This means that if any request goes from private instance to the internet, its response is automatically allowed
But a request from internet to the NAT gateway is not allowed

                							Cleanup
                					*************************

# Delete EC2 instances
# Delete NAT gateway
# Release elastic IP
# Delete custom VPC
