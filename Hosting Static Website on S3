# Add your static content in the bucket , copy the bucket website endpoint and you are good to go

# If you have a domain , you can add the hosted zone in Route 53 (you need to create hosted zone and S3 bucket with the your domain name)

# Add the AWS provided name servers mentioned in your hosted zone in your domain panel name servers

# Create a CNAME record, in the value mention your bucket endpoint. It will take some time for the settings to reflect. After a few hours check your domain and your static website will be available 

# Alternatively you can use AWS amplify to deploy your S3 static content, add your custom domains or enable firewall. AWS will take care of SSL certifictes
